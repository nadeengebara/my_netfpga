PDCN-2721#1 Critical Warning
IBUFDS_GT_loads_clock_region  
IBUFDS_GTE2 IBUFDS_GTE2_inst drives MMCME2_ADV control_sub_i/nf_mbsys/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcm_adv_inst in a different clock region and must do so using local routing resources which may negatively affect clock performance. Use CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE set to FALSE to indicate this is intended.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.
